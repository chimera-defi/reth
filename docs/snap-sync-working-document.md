# Snap Sync Working Document

## üéØ **Project Status**

**Current Phase**: Research and Learning Complete  
**Overall Progress**: 40% Complete  
**Next Phase**: Core Snap Sync Logic Implementation  

## üìö **Key Learnings and Research**

### **What We Learned**
1. **Snap Sync is Two-Phase**: Not a standalone replacement, but a two-phase process
2. **State Root Discovery is Critical**: Must query peers for recent state roots
3. **State Verification is Essential**: Must verify Merkle proofs and reconstruct state trie
4. **Integration with Forward Sync**: Must work WITH forward sync, not replace it
5. **State Healing is Required**: Must detect and fix missing state data

### **What We Got Right**
- ‚úÖ Basic architecture and stage ordering
- ‚úÖ CLI integration and configuration
- ‚úÖ Progress reporting and metrics
- ‚úÖ Testing framework
- ‚úÖ Component structure

### **What We Got Wrong**
- ‚ùå Incorrect understanding of snap sync flow
- ‚ùå Missing state root discovery mechanism
- ‚ùå Missing state verification and validation
- ‚ùå Missing state healing mechanisms
- ‚ùå Incorrect integration with forward sync

## üèóÔ∏è **Proper Snap Sync Architecture**

### **Two-Phase Process**

#### **Phase 1: State Download**
```
1. Query peers for recent state roots
2. Select suitable recent state root (1-2 days old)
3. Download account ranges for that state root
4. Download storage ranges for each account
5. Download byte codes
6. Download trie nodes for verification
7. Verify all downloaded data using Merkle proofs
8. Reconstruct state trie and verify state root
```

#### **Phase 2: Forward Sync**
```
1. Start from the snap sync point
2. Download headers from snap point to tip
3. Download bodies for those headers
4. Execute transactions and update state
5. Continue normal sync process
```

### **Key Components**

#### **State Root Discovery**
- Query peers for their latest state roots
- Select suitable recent state root
- Verify state root is valid

#### **State Verification**
- Verify Merkle proofs for all downloaded data
- Reconstruct state trie from downloaded data
- Verify state root matches target

#### **State Healing**
- Detect missing state data
- Re-download missing data from different peers
- Verify state consistency

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Start with Task 1.1**: State Root Discovery System
2. **Set up development environment** for snap sync testing
3. **Create feature branch** for snap sync implementation
4. **Set up CI/CD** for automated testing

### **Development Guidelines**
1. **Follow Reth conventions** for code style and structure
2. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
3. **Document as you go** - don't leave documentation for the end
4. **Test with real data** - don't rely only on mocks
5. **Performance matters** - optimize for speed and memory usage

## üìù **Notes and Observations**

### **Key Insights**
1. **Snap sync is not a replacement** for traditional sync, but a complement
2. **State integrity is paramount** - must verify all downloaded data
3. **Error recovery is critical** - network failures are common
4. **Performance optimization** is essential for user experience
5. **Testing with real data** is crucial for validation

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
1. **Don't skip state verification** - data integrity is critical
2. **Don't ignore error recovery** - network failures are common
3. **Don't optimize prematurely** - get it working first, then optimize
4. **Don't skip testing** - snap sync is complex and error-prone
5. **Don't forget documentation** - users need clear guidance

This working document serves as the central reference for the snap sync implementation project.
