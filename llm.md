# SnapSync Implementation Review & Progress

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **COMMENT-CODE MISALIGNMENT**
- Comments claim "real implementation" but code has major gaps
- Database writes removed but comments suggest they exist
- Async handling comments don't match actual implementation

### 2. **ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS**
- SnapSync implemented as single stage instead of sync strategy replacement
- Database writes completely removed (non-functional)
- Async/sync boundary confusion
- Integration bypassed in sets.rs

### 3. **CODE QUALITY ISSUES**
- Unused variables and imports
- Incomplete error handling
- Missing core functionality

## ðŸ“‹ REVIEW CHECKLIST

### Core Files to Review:
- [ ] `snap_sync.rs` - Main implementation
- [ ] `snap_sync_tests.rs` - Test coverage
- [ ] `sets.rs` - Pipeline integration
- [ ] `config.rs` - Configuration
- [ ] `id.rs` - Stage ID

### Critical Functions to Verify:
- [ ] `execute()` - Database writes
- [ ] `poll_execute_ready()` - Async handling
- [ ] `process_account_ranges()` - Data processing
- [ ] `verify_account_range_proof()` - Security
- [ ] `get_target_state_root()` - State management

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Install dependencies and compile locally**
2. **Run existing tests**
3. **Line-by-line code review**
4. **Fix comment-code misalignments**
5. **Implement missing database writes**
6. **Add proper tests for new functionality**

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS TRACKING

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [x] Install Rust toolchain

- [x] Review tests (found major import issues - FIXED)
- [ ] Review integration
- [ ] Document all issues found

### Phase 3: Fixes
- [ ] Fix comment-code misalignments
- [ ] Implement database writes
- [ ] Fix async handling
- [ ] Add missing tests

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Compile successfully
